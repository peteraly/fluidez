## 1. Processability Theory Audit

### Overview
Processability Theory (Pienemann) states that learners can only acquire grammatical structures in a fixed developmental sequence. This audit verifies that grammar is introduced in the correct order.

## 2. Noticing Hypothesis Audit

### Overview
The Noticing Hypothesis (Schmidt) states that learners must consciously notice forms to acquire them. This audit verifies that attention-directing techniques are applied to all grammar points.

### Techniques Checked
1. Color Coding
2. Pre-Pattern Callouts ("What do you notice about...?")
3. Post-Pattern Callouts ("Did you notice?")
4. Input Flooding (5+ examples)
5. Typographic Salience (bold, underline, morpheme boundaries)
6. Structural Highlighting ([S][V][O] markers)

### Coverage by Day

|-----|---------------|----------|
| 1 | 3 | 50% |
| 2 | 3 | 50% |
